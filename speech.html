    <h1>My Speech</h1>
    <h3>In case you missed it</h3>
    <p>Good morning Everyone,</p>
    <p>My name is Aarnav, and I am standing for the position of School Captain as my first preference, and Principal’s Representative as my second.</p>
    <p>Throughout my time here, I’ve taken part in several school activities—academically, creatively, and through volunteering. I’ve been involved in organizing and supporting different events, contributing to both planning and execution. Behind the scenes, I’ve also worked on solutions to improve how things function in school life, because I believe that every system can be improved with the right mindset.</p>
    <p>For me, leadership is about quiet consistency, not just visible authority. A good leader is someone who listens carefully, acts thoughtfully, and takes responsibility even when no one is watching. They’re not perfect, but they try to do what’s right, especially when it’s not easy.</p>
    <p>I believe I carry these values—I’m dependable, focused, and committed to doing my part to help the school grow. Whether it’s by improving communication, supporting initiatives, or helping the council function more efficiently, I want to ensure that we don’t just speak about ideas—we act on them.</p>
    <p>My vision is simple: to support a council that’s not just organized, but truly collaborative. Where every student feels like their voice matters, and where we move forward not just as individuals, but as a school community.</p>
    <p>I would be honored to have your support, and I promise to serve with dedication and sincerity.</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
