    <h2>Why This Campaign Is for You</h2>
    <p>I understand what it's like when student voices go unheard, or when school feels more stressful than it needs to be. I want to be someone who represents your concerns and ideas with sincerity and care. I’m here to help improve communication, make events smoother, and bring a calm, steady presence to student leadership.</p>
    <p>Let’s make school life better—not louder. Just smarter.</p>
