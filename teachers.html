    <h2>Dear Teachers,</h2>
    <p>Thank you for everything you do behind the scenes to keep this school running. As a student leader, I would bring a mindset focused on organization, responsiveness, and proactive effort.</p>
    <p>If elected, I will strive to be a dependable bridge between students and faculty—one who listens, communicates clearly, and supports the school’s vision through consistent, respectful leadership.</p>
